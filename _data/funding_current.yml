    description:
       "The Orchestrated Platform for Autonomous Laboratories (OPAL)
       is a multi-laboratory initiative led by the U.S. Department of
       Energy (DOE) to turn biological discovery into a self-driving
       process. By combining artificial intelligence (AI), robotics,
       and automated experimentation, OPAL seeks to create a network
       of autonomous laboratories that can learn, adapt, and
       accelerate breakthroughs across biology, biotechnology, and
       energy science.

       At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, OPAL leverages the unique
       capabilities of one of the world’s most advanced automated
       plant research facilities: the Advanced Plant Phenotyping
       Laboratory (APPL). APPL integrates high-resolution imaging,
       robotics, and AI-powered analytics to link genetic variation to
       phenotypic traits, enabling rapid, data-driven plant
       characterization. Scientists are using this unique facility to
       develop plants that can “mine” rare earth elements critical for
       energy technologies."

    role: Co-PI
    period: 10/2023 - 09/2028

    id: DE-SC0024387
    description:
	"Existing adaptive management and resource partitioning
	strategies developed for resilient infrastructures are often
	static, based on rules developed by experts with years of
	experience, and dependent on centralized control. While
	significant attention has been paid to online and dynamic
	resource management using mainstream artificial intelligence
	(AI) methods, their effectiveness has not been demonstrated at
	scale because of their lack of ability to deal with the unique
	set of challenges related to the complexity and scale of the
	resilient infrastructures. The SWARM project explores how
	distributed intelligence, specifically, swarm intelligence
	(SI), can provide robust, performant, resilient, and
	fault-tolerant execution of DOE scientific workflows that span
	across a continuum of resources from edge devices near sensors
	and instruments through wide area networks to leadership-class
	systems. The goal is to design SI-based resilient IRI that can
	quickly recover from failures, adapt to changes in the
	environment, maximize overall resource utilization, and
	optimize the execution time of workflows submitted by DOE
	scientists."

    role: SP
    period: 10/2023 - 09/2028 
    amount: $10,0000,000
    program: US Department of Energy, Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research  
    description:
       "We can optimize the resilience of the workflows by
       intelligently placing the data and processing across the
       distributed resources. This will involve designing and
       developing an intelligent, introspective, and dynamic workflow
       by drawing on a system model based on years of data captured
       from a large-scale production system. It will offer control
       and management capabilities required at all timescales -- from
       NRT to delivery of scientific insight. The overarching goal of
       this proposed work is to conduct research in three areas: 1)
       dynamic modeling (these methods can quantitatively capture
       dynamic and adaptive workflow and system behavior at runtime),
       2) complex high-throughput (HT) and NRT workflows resilience,
       and 3) optimal data placement and resources utilization."

  - title: Multi-workflow Orchestration and Lightweight Integrated Data Analysis Across Facilities
    role: Co-PI
    period: 10/2023 - 09/2025 
    amount: $743,000
    program:  Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program - INTERSECT
    id: 11521
    description:
      Department of Energy (DOE) science requires more experimental
      complexity and computational scale than ever before, with
      multidisciplinary teams spanning across science groups and
      computing facilities. As an example, chemists use an electron
      microscope to generate terabytes of data per hour that are
      preprocessed in the Edge and shipped to an HPC cluster for
      distributed deep learning, which is used to assist the chemist
      to re-tune the microscope (i.e., feedback loop). However, no
      existing solution allows scientists to run a science campaign
      with a series of connected workflows, known as a multi-workflow,
      as a single, systematic, and automated process; hence, they
      instead run the individual pieces at their facility and manually
      transfer data between each step. Coordinating federated and
      heterogeneous scientific tools, workflow, storage systems, and
      facilities is challenging, and addressing these challenges can
      accelerate scientific discoveries and the DOE's mission. Our
      proposal combines Multi-workflow Execution Orchestration and
      Multi-workflow Integrated Data Analysis in a symbiotic manner
      across facilities. To implement this, we use the Zambeze and
      FlowCept frameworks and together they could compose the
      System-of-Systems architecture of INTERSECT. Zambeze acts as the
      controller for workflows across facilities in the control plane,
      while FlowCept interfaces simultaneously with the data and
      control planes to autonomously capture provenance, metadata, and
      pointers to large scientific data files, providing a lightweight
      integrated data view at runtime.

    role: PI
    period: 07/2022 - 07/2024
    amount: $682,431
    program: Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program - Strategic Hire
    id: 11184
    description:
      Extreme scale science requires scientists to combine multiple
      computational tasks in complex workflows, efficiently managing
      large amounts of data, and fully exploiting the performance of
      the entire DOE computing ecosystem, from the edge to
      supercomputers. To this end, ORNL scientists have to express
      their research ideas into these workflows that can be
      implemented by computer scientists. Going from science to
      workflows requires domain scientists to express their needs from
      a different perspective to select the most adapted and efficient
      tools. However, this is an error-prone and tedious process, as
      there is no turnkey solution in such a diverse ecosystem. Thus,
      we will develop a comprehensive simulation-based framework to
      help scientists to easily prototype their scientific workflows,
      while expressing all the important information needed by
      computer scientists to provide them with the most efficient
      implementation. We will be building simulators that allow them
      to get major insights into the expected performance and
      scalability of their workflow as it changes in time. These
      simulators will grow in accuracy and fidelity as we further
      develop this long term vision and engage with all the needed
      actors, from facilities to scientific applications. We will
      eventually create a world-class scientific instrument for the
      performance evaluation of scientific workflows in the early
      stages of their design. Our framework will ultimately lead to
      enhanced productivity and the ability for DOE scientists to run
      their workflows at larger scales.
